We all use a lot of open source projects. Really often we don't even know who is responsible for all the well done projects. You want to see who to thank for hard work?

**Use `credits` and find out on whose work your projects are based on.**

## Basic usage

```
Usage
  $ credits <path>
Options
  -i, --include-packages  Show packages maintained by person
Examples
  $ credits /projects/foo
  $ credits /projects/foo --include-package
```

### So thanks to all these [people](./THANKS.md)!!!
